*Inspired by the original Hyper Monokai Theme

## "So what's the difference? What is the deluxe?"
- You liked hyper-border but like me you didn't like how it uses background gradient to achieve the "borders"? 
I used real borders on the right places to achieve the same. :bomb: 
- You lost track of you active tab? You installed a plugin for that? Not anymore. It's part of the theme and now we have
hightlighted tabs in monokai style. :gem:
- You liked monokai? Yeah, that is still the same. :couple_with_heart:
